# MachineLearningAlgosFromScratch

Welcome to `MachineLearningAlgosFromScratch`, a repository where I explore the inner workings of machine learning algorithms by building them from scratch using vanilla Python, NumPy, and other statistical modules.

## Overview

This repository is designed to offer hands-on experience in implementing fundamental machine learning algorithms. By avoiding high-level libraries that abstract away many details, we aim to gain deeper insights into the algorithms' mechanics and applications.

## Objectives

- **Understand the fundamentals:** Break down complex algorithms into manageable steps to understand each component.
- **Hands-on implementation:** Use Python and NumPy to implement algorithms, ensuring a solid grasp of the techniques.
- **Performance evaluation:** Assess the performance and limitations of each algorithm on various datasets.

## Algorithms Covered

So far, the repository includes the following algorithms:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Means Clustering
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes Classifier

Each algorithm directory contains:

- A detailed implementation of the algorithm in Python.
- A `README.md` file that explains the algorithm's theory, usage, and a simple example.
- Test scripts that apply the algorithm to synthetic and real datasets.
